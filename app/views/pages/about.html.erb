        <p>For the past few years I have been going to UVU to pursue a Biotechnology degree. While going to school I took some programming courses, and fell in love with it. I looked into how long it would take for me to be able to get into the industry to start a career.  I still had 3 years left before I would actually get to build anything interesting.</p>

<p>I decided to go a different route, and got my associates degree, then I went to an accelerated program to help further boost my skills. I have built some really awesome programs using Ruby on Rails, HTML, SCSS, CSS3, Typescript, Javascript, and I am currently building an app using React, Apollo, and GraphQL.

I am currently working full time as a freelance developer building out websites for clients, but I am now also looking for a more stable work environment.</p>
