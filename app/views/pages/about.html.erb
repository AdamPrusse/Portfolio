        <p>For the past few years I have been going to UVU to pursue a Biotechnology degree. While going to school I took some programming courses, and I fell in love with programming.</p>

<p>I decided to get my associates degree at USU, then I went to an accelerated program to help further boost my skills.</p>
<p>I have built some really awesome programs using Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Typescript, Javascript, and I am currently building an app using React, Apollo, and GraphQL.

Currently I am working full time as a freelance developer building out websites for clients, but I am also looking for a more stable work environment.</p>
